                AI & ML are two very hot buzzwords right now in the technology
                domain. AI & ML is an emerging specialization of CSE course of
                B.Tech. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is wide ranging branch of
                computer science concerned with building smart machines callable
                of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
                Machine Learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that
                allow computer programs to automatically improve through
                experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                This 4 year under graduation of computer science & Engineering
                with specialization in Artificial Intelligence & machine
                Learning is designed to make the professional technically sound
                in advanced learning systems that are based on algorithm of
                Artificial Intelligence. This program developed the skills of
                creating fastest working apps or solutions integrated with
                analytical information ensuring 100% accuracy in the output. AI
                makes is expected to grow from USD 21.46 Billion in 2018 to USD
                190.61 billion by 2025.

              <p>
                The students shall explore the practical components of
                developing AI apps and platforms. Proficiency in mathematics
                will thrive, as this degree requires strong problem-solving and
                analytical skills. They shall be able to acquire the ability to
                design intelligent solutions for various business problems in a
                variety of domains and business applications. The students shall
                be exploring fields such as neural networks, natural language
                processing, robotics, deep learning, and computer vision,
                reasoning and problem-solving.
